## Introduction
Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) hold promise for personalized medicine but face challenges in prediction accuracy. This study investigates how simulation parameters affect PRS accuracy using Clumping + Thresholding, BASIL (Lasso-based method in snpnet package), and BayesR (Bayesian Multiple Regression-based method in GCTB package). By manipulating parameters such as effect size distribution and heritability, we aim to understand optimal settings for each method. Our findings will inform the selection of PRS methods for precise disease risk prediction in clinical and research settings, advancing personalized healthcare interventions.
